In this time of weirdness, I will not attempt to make a formal presentation.
Instead I will write out some thoughts that I wanted to present and hopefully my
internet will work well enough to have an informal discussion about them over
video chat at the allotted meeting time. If not, then anyone can feel free to
email me any thoughts at any time: polidorp@janelia.hhmi.org

Science Systems

Modern science is often a very interdisciplinary endeavor. People from a variety
of fields and backgrounds must work together to develop new theories and models,
design and perform experiments, train animals, build scientific instruments to
collect data, analyze the data to discover knowledge, and disseminate and teach
that knowledge to the rest of the world. Science is a diverse system and each
field has its own domain specific language with its own vocabulary and
conventions. Those languages have a great deal of overlap, but connecting this
heterogeneous collection of people and parts is often a real challenge.

I have been looking for ways to help make the people and other components of
science systems more interoperable. I have been finding that getting people to
agree on anything is a way more difficult challenge than any technical problem.
