In this time of weirdness, I will not attempt to make a formal presentation.
Instead I will write out some thoughts that I wanted to present and hopefully my
internet will work well enough to have an informal discussion about them over
video chat at the allotted meeting time. If not, then anyone can feel free to
email me any thoughts at any time: polidorp@janelia.hhmi.org

# Science Systems

Modern science is often a very interdisciplinary endeavor. People from a variety
of fields and backgrounds must work together to develop new theories and models,
design and perform experiments, train animals, build scientific instruments to
collect data, analyze the data to discover knowledge, and disseminate and teach
that knowledge to the rest of the world. Science is a diverse system and each
field has its own domain specific language with its own vocabulary and
conventions. Those languages have a great deal of overlap, but connecting this
heterogeneous collection of people and parts is often a real challenge.

I have been looking for ways to help make the people and other components of
science systems more interoperable. I have been finding that getting people to
agree on anything is a way more difficult challenge than any technical problem.
There are three topics I have been thinking about lately that perhaps could help
connect scientific components in a system and I would like to discuss them with
people and see if anyone agrees before using them in future projects:

[behavior trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00084)

[object process methodology](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15865-0_7)

[robot operating system version 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/)

## Background

Ten years ago or so, I was working in the Dickinson Lab at Caltech along with
about half the people who work at Janelia now. Michael Dickinson would observe
plates of flies and notice patterns in their behavior. He thought of putting a
little magnet on top of the plate next to the flies so they could see it and a
magnet underneath the plate so he could move it with his hand and interact with
the flies and influence their behavior. A science system may be as simple as one
smart scientist theorizing about and experimenting with the world using basic
instruments, converting observations into knowledge. There can be advantages,
though, to making that science system more complex. Adding automation, for
example, can help collect larger quantities of data in a shorter amount of time
and in a more repeatable fashion, freeing scientists to use their brains and
time for more interesting and challenging aspects of the research.
